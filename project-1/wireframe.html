        Welcome to Walcott Island, the last stop on your journey to uncover all
        the secrets of the secretive typographer, Jason Anthony Walcott and his
        greatest achievement, <strong>Baroque JF Text</strong>(<a href='https://www.jukebox-fonts.myshopify.com/products/baroque-text?variant=19713909959'>1</a>).
        This font, completed thousands of years ago (2003), was taken from Captain
        Walcott’s mysterious workshop known as the <a href='https://www.jukebox-fonts.myshopify.com/'>
          "Jukebox"</a> by the scourge of the seven seas, Disney, to be
        used in their kingdom. However, Baroque has now been lost to time and very
        little is known about it. Baroque Text was designed by Jason Anthony
        Walcott in 2003 and has been lost to time and very little is known about
        it.

      <p>
        In order to recover this lost treasure, you set out years ago to find all
        twenty-six pieces of the font and reveal their secret characteristics. Now
        your adventure brings you to Walcott Island were the last letter “S” is
        guarded by the sleepy pirate Vilmoczer.
