              <p> Welcome to your own solar system, the Sol System! Space is a
                big place and it is easy to forget just how far we need to
                travel just get around our home solar system. Hopefully, this
                page will help you understand the distances
                between each planet and provide some interesting facts along the
                way.<br><br>
                To begin your journey through space just scroll to the right.
                Just keep on scrolling and do not worry about how long this will
                take. This website is not as big as the actual solar system. It
                has been scaled down to make your space trip much more
                manageable. Each pixel between the planets represents 100,000
                miles (160,934 km). To make sure you can still see the planets,
                they have only been scaled down to one hundredth of their actual
                size. Make sure to keep this in mind as you travel to the
                leading edge of our solar system.

            <p> The Sun, also known as Sol, is the center of our Solar System
              and the primary energy source for all life within the system. It
              has a diameter of 864,300 miles (1,390,473 km) and makes up for
              99.86% of the solar system’s mass. It is informally classified as
              a yellow dwarf star but in five billion years will transform into
              a red giant before shifting into a white dwarf. </p>

              Mercury consists of 70% metallic and 30% silicate materials. It
              has a diameter of 3031 miles (4878 km). It orbits the sun every 880
              Earth Days and interestingly enough one Mercury day is 176 Earth

            <p> Often referred to as the “sister planet” to Earth because of its
              similar diameter of 7,521 miles (12,103 km) and our proximity to
              each other. It orbits the sun every 224.7 Earth Days and rotates
              every 243 days. The largest difference between Venus and Earth is
              its atmospheric pressure which is 92 times stronger than Earth’s.</p>

              its own axis 366 times during this period. With a diameter of
              7,926 miles (12,755 km), Earth is also the densest planet in the
              Solar System and is the first planet to have a satellite moon

              the fourth and last solid planet in our Solar System. The planet
              gains its reddish hue from the iron deposits which cover its
              surface, but Mars also has two polar icecaps of frozen water. With
              a diameter of 4,222 miles (6,794 km), it has an orbit of 687
              Earth days and a rotation that is only 40 minutes longer than an
              Earth day. Mars also has the two tiny satellite moons, Phobos and
              Deimos. </p>

            <p> As the first and largest gas giant in the Solar System, Jupiter
              is only one-hundredth the mass of the sun. It is composed of
              primarily hydrogen and helium. Its surface layers of atmosphere
              often interact in violent ways and create massive storms the size
              of Earth. Most notably, the Great Red Spot is a distinctive storm
              which was discovered in the 17th century and continues to this day.
              Jupiter also has at least 79 satellite moons.</p>

            <p> The second largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant
              composed of iron-nickel compounds and ammonia crystals. With a
              diameter of 74,900 miles (120,539 km), it orbits the sun every 29
              Earth years and it has a rotation of ten and a half Earth hours.
              Saturn’s most distinctive feature is its concentric rings of
              astronomical objects. These rings include at least 82 satellite
              moons, one of which, Titan, is larger than Mercury and has its own
              atmosphere.</p>

              an orbit of 84 Earth years, and a rotation of seventeen Earth
              hours. It has the coldest atmosphere in the Solar system, reaching

              a similar, if not slightly denser composition to Uranus as well.
              The planets are even similar in size with Neptune’s diameter at
              30,779 miles (49,533 km). Neptune has an orbit of 165 Earth years
              and a rotation of 16 Earth hours. Its biggest difference is its
              weather systems. The fastest windspeeds in the Solar System have
              been recorded on Neptune with in the Great Dark Spot system at
              approximately 1,300mph (2,100km/h). Neptune also has 14 known

            <p> Welcome to the beginning of the end. The Kupier belt is the
              collection of asteroids, dwarf planets, and comets that orbit
              around the Sun but are too small to make significant note. Of
              course, this also includes the former planet, now dwarf planet,
              Pluto alongside two other dwarf planets, Huamea and Makemake. This
              belt extends from 2,734,033,246 miles from the Sun to the edges of
              the Sun’s gravitational pull nearly 2 light-years away.<br><br>

              The only human spacecraft to leave the Solar System have been
              Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 which are classified as traversing the
              interstellar medium. Voyager 1 will run out of power in 2025
              while Voyager 2 will continue on alone.</p>
